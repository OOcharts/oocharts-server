Pick whatever `Project name` and `Project ID` you'd like. I use \"OOcharts Server\" for the name and choose whatever project ID is generated for me.\r\n\r\nOnce the project has been created, navigate to the `APIs & auth` section.\r\n\r\nUnder `APIs`, turn on \"Analytics API\" and turn off any other APIs that may default to on (Such as \"Google Cloud SQL\").\r\n\r\nNext, go the `Credentials`. Select \"Create a New Client ID\". OOcharts is a `Web Application`. Remove the `Authorized JavaScript origins` and put whatever server IP or Url you will be using for OOcharts. By default, OOcharts runs on port `4004` and has a callback url of `/setup/google-callback`. If I way hosting OOcharts under `mysite.com`, I would put as the `Authorized redirect URI`: `http://mysite.com:4004/setup/google-callback`. Once finished, create the client Id.\r\n\r\nOnce the ID is created, take note of the `Client ID` and `Client secret` provided. We will need them when we setup OOcharts.\r\n\r\n### Setting up OOcharts\r\n\r\nOOcharts requires `nodejs` and `npm` to run.\r\n\r\nDownload OOcharts to wherever you'd like to run it from. Direct your console to the root of the project, and then run `node app`.\r\n\r\nNavigate to `/setup`.\r\n\r\nFill in the information. Make sure the host URL matches the host you used when setting up your Google project. In my case, I would use `http://mysite.com:4004`. If the setup worked correctly, you should be redirected to Google for authentication. Once complete, you will be provided your API Key. Use OOcharts just like before!\r\n\r\n### Reset\r\n\r\nYou can reset OOcharts from running the bash script in the project root:\r\n\r\n`bash configure.sh`\r\n\r\nor by replacing the file contents of `config/env/config.json` with:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"state\" : \"installed\",\r\n    \"port\" : \"4004\"\r\n}\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
